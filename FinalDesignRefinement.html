                                    We decided to enhance the visual design of the application by changing
                                    the color, font, and icon images. The new colors and fonts make the app
                                    more engaging, while updated icons help clarify a button’s function. The
                                    new visual design will also contribute to a more uniform visual design,
                                    which addresses a piece of feedback we received in our heuristic evaluation.
                                    We didn't have time to implement the visual design in our prototype&mdash;instead
                                    we made photoshop mockups.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="span5">
                                <h3>
                                    Displaying Workouts
                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    Our evaluators felt that the display and organization of the workouts
                                    was not ideal, saying the lists were too long, which requiring a lot of
                                    scrolling. They recommended adding a way to organize the workouts by type.
                                    We decided not to change this because we believe our design works well
                                    for personal trainers.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When we first started designing, we tested out different ways of searching
                                    for exercises. For example, we had options to search by tapping on an image
                                    of a body, but we found in our tests that it took up too much space, added
                                    too much clutter, and that everyone always went straight to the search
                                    bar anyway. Personal trainers, in particular, know the exact names for
                                    their workouts, and don't need to filter by "workout type" because it is
                                    much faster for them to start typing the workout name.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Thus, the time we invest in determining different ways to organize lists,
                                    body parts etc, will be disproportionate the to value added to the application.

                                    When the evaluators added a workout, they were surprised that the app
                                    didn't give them any immediate feedback that the workout had been added.
                                    The workout would simply appear as a list item as it did before they added
                                    it. In order to see what workouts had been added, it was necessary to click
                                    the "done" button. Only once they did this, could they see the details
                                    of what they had added.

                                    We had already designed a feedback system in our paper prototype, but
                                    hadn't implemented it in our functional prototype yet. When a trainer adds
                                    a workout, it floats to the top of the list, and grey text appears underneath
                                    the workout, indicating how many sets have been added. The workouts that
                                    have been added, and the workouts that the trainer most often uses, appear
                                    seperated from the entire workout list by a thick grey divider.

                            We wanted to improve the flow of saving workouts. In our experiment design,
                            we want to test the effects of having done buttons, “saved” notifications,
                            and appearance of textboxes on the user’s confidence and the time needed
                            to complete their task.

                            Our workouts autosave, but we wanted to test the effects of having explicit
                            &quot;done&quot; buttons, because we were concerned that people wouldn&#39;t
                            realize that their workouts were being saved, without clicking a &quot;done&quot;
                            or a &quot;save&quot; button.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We tested the form with a done button. And the same form without it.

                            Upon saving the workout, we also gave the user feedback by displaying
                            a green &quot;workouts saved&quot; notification at the top of the screen
                            for 1 second. We observed how confident users were that their workouts
                            had been saved, with, and without this notification.

                            marks next to the workout as it was saved, as opposed to displaying a large
                            green banner.

                            produce the optimal version. We will see how these variations and combinations

                            In running our experiment, we would ideally test 10 subjects to get a
                            data set that would point to what the average person might think. Unfortunately,
                            we do not have time in the scope of this project, so we have set up two
                            experiments with personal trainers and plan to test it a few more times
                            with fellow students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each subject would do five iterations of the adding, saving, and editing
                            workouts, each time with a different random combination of the variable
                            factors. There are 16 different variations to test, so by having them complete
                            five, they will help us get data for most of the variations while controlling
                            for possible individual differences. We will not ask them to do all eight
                            because that will become too repetitive for them and would take too much
                            of the subject’s time. We will also give each subject variable combinations
                            in a random order to control for possible ordering effects as well as familiarity
                            biases.

                            For example, Joanne would get a "done" button, and checkbox notifications
                            on her first test, and on Robert's first test, he would get a "saved" notification,
                            have no "done" button, and see textbox borders disappear after going to
                            the next one. Our team has no prior experience in the design of controlled
                            experiments, so we not only will take away useful design information from
                            this test, but we will also apply what we learn in future experiments we
                            may do outside of class. It will be interesting to understand how much
                            and what types of reassurance users need in trusting that the program has
                            saved their data inputs.

                            We conducted three formal usability experiments: one with a personal trainer
                            and two with Olin students. We also conducted two informal usability tests.
                            Although we had a small sample size, we believe that our validity remains
                            strong. We learned the following:

                                    We ask her if it feels like her information is saved and she responds,
                                    “ It doesn’t feel like the information that i entered had been recorded
                                    before I press the done button”. Without the done button, she feels like
                                    she hasn’t saved any of the inputted exercises.

                                    She tried to add a set but the buttons were too close, so there were some

                                    notes that he sees a done button. As such, he is going to go ahead and
                                    click on it and is satisfied that it takes him to the client workouts,
                                    which is exactly what he anticipated and wanted. When asked if he felt
                                    like the data was saved, he says “No, there is not enough of a feedback
                                    to tell me that it is saved.”

                                    He also mentions that he thinks the layout is good he doesn’t need to look
                                    anywhere else in order to add a workout for a person because the layout
                                    tells him which buttons to press.

                                    With the addition of a second done button, James says that out of the
                                    two done buttons that he sees, he is going to click on the one underneath
                                    the rep/set buttons. He also mentions that it is very clear that the data
                                    is saved and that he can now add more workouts without having to go to
                                    the review page.

                                    He suggests that we might want to change the done button underneath the
                                    set/lbs buttons or change the diction on the button because having two
                                    done buttons is confusing.

                                    that he does not have a layout preference when it comes to check marks.

                            Problem with the spinner
                        </h5>
                        <div class="row">

                                <img src="img/spinning_icon.png" style="float:left;">
                                Ryan was initially confused by the spinning icon that appeared next to
                                a workout set while he was typing. He had started typing in the &quot;minutes&quot;
                                field, and the spinning icon appeared.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="row">
                            <p class="span">
                                <img src="img/check_mark.png" style="float:left;">
                                This icon indicates that the app is trying to save the workout. Usually,
                                it disappears quickly, and is replaced by a check mark, if the workout
                                form has been filled out completely. This is intended to keep the trainer
                                informed of the app&#39;s internal state. If it weren&#39;t transparent,
                                and didn&#39;t show a spinning icon when it is in the process of saving,
                                then the trainer using it could be confused about whether or not the app
                                is actually doing anything, and could navigate away from the page before
                                the green checkmark appears.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Mistakenly, we made the spinning icon appear while the form was not completely
                            filled out (e.g., Ryan had only begun typing in the minutes field). This
                            made Ryan feel as if he could not go on to the &quot;miles&quot; field,
                            until the spinner stopped spinning. He was afraid that minutes would not
                            be saved.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our spinner distracted him, making him think that the app was &quot;busy&quot;
                            and that he could take no further action. We fixed this issue by making
                            the spinning icon only appear briefly, representing that the app noticed
                            that he started typing, and briefly to save the form, but didn&#39;t.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When a workout is added, we make it appear at the top of the workouts
                            list, so that the trainer can see that it has been added. We also separate
                            it visually from the other workouts by a thick divider line. In our paper
                            prototype, we also wrote under the workout &quot;[x] sets logged&quot;
                            to indicate that the trainer had added something.

                        <p>
                            We used a prototype with Ryan that had a divider line (indicating that
                            &quot;Buns-Up Leg Press and &quot;Abdominal Crunch&quot; had been added),
                            as opposed to the workouts below the line, which hadn&#39;t been added.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ryan was confused as to what the line meant, and sometimes didn&#39;t
                            notice that the workouts had even moved (for example, when the workout
                            was already near the top of the list). Based on this feedback, we modified
                            the interface to make it more clear which workouts had been added.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                We added two headers, Today&#39;s Workouts , and More Workouts to the
                                list.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                As the trainer adds workouts, they move up to the Today&#39;s Workouts
                                list.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                We added grey text next to workouts indicating what had been added (e.g.
                                &quot;1 set&quot;). This text was in our original paper prototype as well.

                            Now it is much more clear when a workout has been added, and the trainer
                            can easily see the state of their workout list, and see, at a glance, which
                            workouts they have already added.

                        <p>

                            Ryan thought the &quot;Workouts Saved&quot; notification that appeared
                            at the top of the screen was worrisome because it only appeared for a second,
                            it slid in and out like an &quot;alert&quot; and he didn&#39;t get a chance
                            to read it. He felt that he had possibly missed an &quot;error message.&quot;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ryan preferred the workouts form without a done button , with checkmarks
                            , and without &quot;saved&quot; notifications . &quot;why would you have
                            a done button if it saves automatically as I type?&quot;
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                            Betty Lee and Tim Valencia: college students
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            In two separate informal user tests with Betty and Tim, they both initially
                            thought the check marks were a &quot;confirmation button&quot; to click
                            on, and tried tapping on it. Understandably so! The check mark is shaped
                            similarly to the &quot;delete&quot; button in our original design.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We adapted the check mark to look more like an unclickable notification,
                            and less like a button. Hopefully this will result in less confusion in
                            the future.

                        <h3>
                            If we had more time
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            We would perform more tests, be more thorough when recording times, and
                            try modifying the green notification banner. It seemed to help, but also
                            was distracting, and in one case, worrisome for the user. It&#39;s possible
                            that we could display this confirmation next to the name of the workout,
                            similar to the grey text. We could use this in with, or without green check
                            marks, and see if there is a significant difference.

                        <p>
                            We would also test out duplicating a workout when the trainer enters a
                            new set, and see if that improves efficiency of entering workouts.
