            Originally in our storyboard, we had focused on scheduling, since personal 
            trainers often had trouble with rescheduling and filling their days, as well 
            as on timeliness of client arrivals, since clients would sometimes come late, 
            throwing the personal trainer off schedule. These were problems that we had 
            uncovered during our interview, but we eventually decided instead to reframe our 
            design goal into facilitating the interface for logging workouts. Stemming for 
            the uniquely personal trainer problem, this reframing allowed us to focus on a 
            task that personal trainers constantly face with unsuccessful technological tools. 
            Since logging workouts is a very tedious task, trainers often revert back to the 
            classic pen and paper approach, a simple and easy approach. Thus, our focus for 
            this design refinement was on the task of logging (add and editing) workouts.

            With the problem reframing in mind, we knew that we had to make a fast and very 
            responsive interface. At first, we used a scroll interface to allow users to
            select number for workout weights and repetitions because OS X uses this type. 
            After speed tests,  we realized that the scroll is not as fast as we had imagined 
            because the user often speeds over the number that she wanted to select. Instead, 
            we switched to a numerical pad, where the user could easily and accurately select 
            the numbers they wanted. The pad provides a large surface area for the user to 
            select, making sure that the user can select the correct number on the first try. 
            The numeric keypad also has a delete button, so that edits can be made.

            <p>
            From our first round of user studies with Shannon, we redesigned our placement, 
            labeling, and grouping of our icons. In our paper prototype, we had a figure with 
            the client's name next to it on the top left and middle of the header with a gear 
            at the top right. The gear had an ambiguous function and was not necessary to have
            in the workflow of the user. On the footer, we had three icons: multiple profiles 
            layered, a trophy, and a horizontal bar graph. One of the icons referred to all of
            the clients while the other two referred to the specific client whose profile the 
            user is in. The multiple profiles layered together represents the button to bring 
            the user back to the main page with all of the clients' profiles. The trophy 
            represented the client's goals but so of our testers did not think that the trophy
            symbolized it well enough. The horizontal bar graph connects to the client's 
            progress page with all the graphs. People were confused by this icon because they 
            were not used to seeing horizontal bars. 
            </p>

            <p>
            In our refined prototype, we placed a back arrow on the top left with the label 
            "All Clients". This provides an intuitive button for the user to return to the 
            home page with all of the client profiles listed. The back arrow represents that 
            the user will be going back to the beginning. By having this on every page, the 
            user can easily maneuver around to whatever page she wishes in one click. In the 
            middle of the top bar, a profile icon with the client's name reminds the user of 
            which client profile is in progress. On the top right hand side, there is either a
            pencil edit button or a "Done" button. Since the right side usually represents 
            "done" or "move on", it seemed like the most logical and natural position to place
            these buttons. On the bottom, per Shannon's advice, we placed buttons that were 
            specific to this client and this client's profile, so that the user would not get 
            confused with which client these icons referred. We added the icon "measure" with 
            a tape measure to represent the page where the personal trainer could track the 
            client's measurements of progress, like bicep circumference or weight. The workout
            logging page is represented by a clipboard and the label "work out". Progress is 
            represented by a bar graph that has vertical bars. We switched the bars to be 
            vertical because this is more common and easily recognizable. The graphs helps to 
            represent a visual representation of progress and other data points. The fourth
            icon on the bottom is the trophy labeled "All of these icons are highlighted when 
            the user is on that page to inform the user of where she is.

            Searching and Selecting Workouts
            </h3>

            </li>
            </ul>
            

            <p>
            The low-fidelity prototype had three ways to search and select workouts: by 
            clicking the body part of an image, typing with auto-complete, or clicking the
            list of most commonly used workouts. In the workout logging page, we wanted to 
            have multiple ways that the user could operate easily, so we thought a visual 
            representation of the body would be helpful. If you clicked on the arm of the 
            image, the screen would auto-populate with workouts that exercised the arm. Our 
            user testings showed us that people did not realize that you could click on these 
            figures to help find workouts. Furthermore, having a split image of the body was 
            unfamiliar to our users who have been trained to view detailed muscular systems. 
            In our revised prototype, we simplified the search/selection process to two methods: 
            typing with auto-complete and clicking the list of most commonly used workouts. 
            These methods are fast and straightforward. 
            </p>



            <h2 id="cognitive-walkthrough">Cognitive Walkthrough</h2>
            <p>
                For our coginitive walkthrough, we focused on the following tasks:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Adding a new client </li>
                <li> Adding goals for a new client </li>
                <li> Adding a workout </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For the first two tasks, a lot of our feedback was relevant to the visual design of the application. The person we tested with found the lack of color intimidating, and thought the amount of white space in the app made use somewhat intimidating. The tester also recommended we change the way we give trainers feedback about the quality of the goals they enter: rather than including opinionated text, he recommended we use text highlighting (reminiscent of how Microsoft Word highlights typos). He felt the text was too opinionated, and could get in the way of a trainer.
            </p>
            <p>
                We feel the most critical feedback we received was around the third task we included in the walkthrough: adding a workout. The tester felt that the system gave him absolutely no feedback when he added a workout. This caused the tester to try to enter the same workout multiple times, and was an obvious violation of standard usability guidelines. In response to this feedback, we implemented several feedback mechanisms that immediately inform a trainer that their information is saved, and clue the trainer about what was added.
            </p>

            <div class="manual-inset">
            <p>
            Our goal was to redesign the method that personal trainers use to log their 
            client's workouts. In designing our prototype, we wanted an interface that would 
            not need a manual but these list of instructions can still add as a helping guide 
            especially since the prototype is still being developed. 
            <br>
            The prototype simulates the touchscreen on an iPhone or iPad that a personal 
            trainer might have and use to aid them in their occupation.

            <h3>
            Let's Get Started!
            </h3>
            <p>
            To get started, tap the profile image of the client you wish to view on the 
            homepage. Search for the client by scrolling down the page until you can see the 
            image of the client you have in mind. The client list should be listed by how 
            recent their last appointment was, so the clients who are scheduled to come in 
            next will have their profiles at the top of the page. This is based off the 
            information originally imputed in the core client profile.
            </p>

            <h3>
            Add a Workout
            </h3>
            <p>
            After selecting the client profile for whom you wish to add a workout for, tap the
            clipboard icon with the label "workout". On this page, there is a search bar at
            the top of the screen, there you can tap the search bar and begin to start typing 
            in the exercise you have in mind. If you have already worked out with this client 
            you can either use the search bar or select an exercise from the pre-populated 
            list of most popular exercises for that specific client. When the exercise you 
            wants appears on the screen, add that exercise by tapping the "+" button. The 
            screen will then split and open up a section that allows you to input more 
            information about that exercise, such as repetitions, sets, weight, time, etc if 
            applicable. Tap the "done" button on the bottom right when you have filled out all
            of the corresponding information. 
            </p>

            <h3>
            Edit Workout
            </h3>

            <p>
            In order to change the details of a workout that has already been added, you must go to the workout
            summary page first by tapping  the "workout" clipboard icon on the bottom of the screen. Click the "Edit/Pencil" button on the right hand side of the specific exercise that you wish to edit. Using the same interface and format from when you originally entered the data, select the correct numbers on the numerical keyboard. Complete this task by selecting the "done" button. 
            </p>

            <h3>
            View Workout History
            </h3>

            <p>
            To browse through all past workouts for a specific client, you simply click on the profile of the client that you want to view the history for. Once in the specific client's profile, select the "add a workout" link or the "work out" icon on the bottom of the screen. A list of all past workouts will be displayed. You can scroll through the workouts to see previous dates.
            </p>

            <h3>
            View Client Progress
            </h3>

            <p>
            To see how the client's workout progress relates to their goals, you can view a graphical visualization of how the client has done over time. After selecting the client from the client home screen, tap "add a workout". In this screen, click the graph icon labeled "Progress" at the bottom right of the screen. This pulls up the charts onto the screen.
