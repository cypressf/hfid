  <h2>Robert White the Gym Sergeant</h2>
  <p class="age">Age 57</p>
  <img class="img-polaroid" src="img/robert_white.jpg" width="150px" style="float:right;margin:1em;">
    <p>Rob is a disciplined, practical, and efficient trainer. With roots in an affluent family, he played sports at a young age, and became competitive in football and lacrosse. After achieving a masters in health and fitness at the University of Pittsburgh, Rob started his own gym, where he now teaches group fitness lessons, in addition to coaching kids basketball. In order to keep his business and personal life separate, Rob follows a strict daily regimen. Rob prefers to communicate with his clients via pamphlets, and blanket announcements to his team. He doesn't use a computer for scheduling, but instead writes down dates on a calendar posted in the gym lobby.</p>

    <h2>Ben Sakai the Partner</h2>

    <p class="age">Age 28</p>
    <img class="img-polaroid" src="img/ben_sakai.jpg" width="150px" style="float:right;margin:1em;">

    <p>Ben was obese for most of his childhood, and when he attended UCSB to study astrophysics, he took the opportunity to turn over a new leaf. He committed to lose weight, and change his lifestyle. He became an avid mountain biker, and learned to love health food. After graduating, he moved to Arizona to enjoy the outdoors and work part-time at an observatory. Ben started to work part-time as a personal trainer at a local gym because it was very rewarding to offer hope to others who wanted to lose weight. In his eyes, his clients are partners, and friends. He talks with them throughout the week via email, and chats in person while doing workouts. He specializes on 1-on-1 training, and whenever he takes on a client, he never compromises his own personal life schedule to accommodate clients.</p>

  <h2>Mike Spiros the Life Coach</h2>

  <p class="age">Age 41</p>
  <img class="img-polaroid" src="img/mike_spiros.jpg" width="150px" style="float:right;margin:1em;">

  <p>Mike is a recently divorced single father, who devotes his life to one mission: making people healthy. He started his own business as a personal trainer because he wants control over every aspect of his training--he targets his training to fit his clients very specific goals, and gives them advice about everything from exercise routines, to diet and daily habits. He owns his own equipment, and doesn't use a gym, opting to instead make home-visits to clients. Mike feels pressure to stay fit, to set a good example for his clients. He is constantly working, either researching health facts, texting clients with reminders, or shifting around his schedule to incorporate new meeting times. He feels that all his effort has gone to waste when clients don't show up for sessions.</p>
